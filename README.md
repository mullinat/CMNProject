What is the plan?<br>
<br>
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE DIVS SCROLLABLE<br>
Requirements:<br>
  We need a live area to talk with channels<br>
Problems:<br>
  I think I should just make my own comment system with socket.io and store it with JSON or SQL<br>
  How are the comments actaully being stored<br>
  I need to figure out how to give users UNIQUE usernames<br>
  How can past comments be stored and rebroadcast<br>
Plan<br>
  Figure out the username thing<br>
  Start storing all the comments on the server in an organized way<br>
  Get the two example chat apps up and running, the problem is that submit actiavetes both at the same time.<br>
