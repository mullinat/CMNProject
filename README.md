What is the plan?<br>
<br>
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE DIVS SCROLLABLE<br>
Requirements:<br>
  We need a live chat<br>
  We need a live area to talk with channels<br>
  We need an embeded youtube video<br>
    Can we track where the person is in the video<br>
How to achive Requirements<br>
  WEBSOCKETS<br>
Projects to base this on<br>
  websocket chat-example source code<br>
  some-comments source code<br>
Problems:<br>
  I think I should just make my own comment system with socket.io and store it with JSON<br>
  How will the div's be divided up<br>
  Will this project have a home page<br>
  How are the comments actaully being held<br>
  Understanding how the comment source code works<br>
  How will the site be explained<br>
Plan<br>
  Review Socket.io<br>
  Look into bootstrap<br>
  Make the divs<br>
  Plan out the comment system<br>
  Get the two example chat apps up and running, the problem is that submit actiavetes both at the same time.<br>
