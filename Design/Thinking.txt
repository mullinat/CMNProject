I can assign a unique ID to all comments and stuff
  When I update a live comment from someone else I can have it send out to everyone else
  This is not scalable
  I should use REST
    GET and Post
    Run in background
    loop every couple seconds
Use socket.io for live chat and use REST for Reddit and comment stuff
  For live question feed I can still use socket.io because it is all in a SQL database
I should make separate pages for stuff
  Separate live chat page, for every video
  Separate comment page for every video
Customize classroom
  Make video larger
  Disable live chat
  Custom size everything with drag and drop bars
Crypto
  HTTPS
  REST encrypted
  Encrypt socket.io stuff using the REST stuff
Passport.js
  Have people login to this site and track what they do
Have section of site that a user can use to track where their comments are
