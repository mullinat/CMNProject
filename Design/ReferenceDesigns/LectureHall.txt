The reference design is the university lecture hall and the university lecture of today
Let's do a usage scenario
  Get to university
  Go to class
  Sit down in class
  Lecture starts
  Class announcements and reminders
  Take notes
    on laptop or notebook
  Ask / Listen to questions
  Possibly talk to prof
  Go home
Problems with reference Design
  Can not pause, rewind, or control speed
  Essentially zero feedback for both prof and student
    iClickers, TopHat
  Students can only ask so many questions
  It never goes at students pace always too slow or too fast
  Does not engage the student they just sit there and listen / fall asleep
  Bias as fuck because it is a single persons opinion
    Presentation yesterday they just skipped over education because they do not want to focus on it this year I disagree
  Discussions are too big and only the smart / extrovert students participate
  Human attention span is not two hours, 90 min max
  Does not encourage critical thinking because it is mostly one persons opinion
